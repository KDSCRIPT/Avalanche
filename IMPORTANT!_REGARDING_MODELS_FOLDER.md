I have saved all models in  folders called forecast_models_single_digit(0 to 9) and forecast_models_double_digit(10 to 15) which is of big size and cannot be uploaded directly in github.

To use the deployment folder and run the website we need the h5 files of model.Follow the instructions

1.Download 

[forecast_models_single_digit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f6eRjAzXdX4shzsG8-hd_BKD9L_or-Rb?usp=drive_link)

[forecast_models_double_digit](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pGErfyYw8cBDG7xzaFeiLrBeWXyNnHFM?usp=drive_link)

2.Unzip the folders and move these folders to the deployment folder.Only then you will be able to access the models .h5 files.

3.Please check for correct paths after the above steps.

4.Run model_runner first to get forecasted values as a binary file and then run the script.py

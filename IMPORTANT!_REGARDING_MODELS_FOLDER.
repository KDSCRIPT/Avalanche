I have saved all models in a folder called models which is of big size and cannot be uploaded directly in github.
To use the deployment folder and run the website we need the h5 files of model.Follow the instructions
1.Download the [models_folder](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45228395/error-no-module-named-fcntl)
2.Unzip the folder and move this folder to the deployment folder.Only then you will be able to access the model .h5 files.
3.Please check for correct paths after the above steps.
